## Chapter 8. Reactive Programming with Project Reactor and Spring WebFlux

This chapter introduces reactive programming, discusses its origins and reasons for being, and demonstrates how Spring is leading the development and advancement of numerous tools and technologies that make it one of the best possible solutions for numerous use cases. More specifically, I demonstrate how to use Spring Boot and Project Reactor to drive database access using SQL and NoSQL databases, integrate reactive types with view technologies like Thymeleaf, and take interprocess communication to unexpected new levels with RSocket.
